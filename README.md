# your-note-taker-app

The objective of this site is to create an effective note taking site.


User Story:

AS A small business owner, 

I WANT to be able to write and save notes, 

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.


Description: 

GIVEN a note-taking application, 

WHEN I open the Note Taker, 

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page, 

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page, 

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column, 

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text, 

THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page, 

WHEN I click on the Save icon, 

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes, 

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, 

THEN that note appears in the right-hand column, 

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, 

THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
